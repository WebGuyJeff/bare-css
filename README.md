# Bare CSS 🍑

This is a basic CSS stylesheet, on which to build complete themes. The intended purpose, is to provide a solid jumping-off point which is more developed than the usual skeleton starters, minimilising the amount of creative grind required to get HTML visualised. It's comprehensive enough to be used as a simple theme, but will need more work as soon as more complex components are included in the project. It aims to be neither lacking, nor suffocating.

## Why?

I find myself stuck between expansive libraries which have done all the fun stuff already (bootstrap), and starters which don't seem to add much to the already barebones styles applied by the browser. On top of this, I rarely find CSS written in a way that makes sense to my brain, so rather than chewing through typography, buttons and box/border style choices each time I start a project, I thought I'd get organised with my own 'Bare CSS'.

### What this is not:
 - A CSS reset
 - Opinion-free
 - A complete style library

### What this is:
 - My flavour of vanilla styles for the core HTML elements, and basic patterns.
 - Styles which could be used as a finished (albeit very plain) theme.
 - A good starting point for new projects.

#### Feedback
If you feel something is missing which should be included at this level of 'bareness' or if you find something that's simply 💩, I welcome all input. Additionally, if you use it and find any of it useful, ping me some ❤.
